# vet
vet (Visual Editing Tool) is a custom made notepad-like text editor made entirely in ImGUI and C++.

## pros

All of the UI is custom fitted with ImGUI to provide a fancy editing experience. vet is fitted with a document system where you can manage multiple files at once, and move between them seamlessly. You can open, save, and close files using the "file" tab at the top of the program. There are even popups for maximum productivity.

## cons

Because this is the first time I've worked with C++ and memory management, expect vet to be a little unstable. Errors like file-sharing violations and memory overflow can occur within vet and will crash the program. Make sure to save often! :)

## releases

You can find all versions of vet in the "Releases" tab to the right of the page.

## contributions

  If for some reaosn you would like to mess around with vet, go ahead and fork the project, then mess around with main.cpp. When your done, send over a pull request. I don't know why anyone would try and even touch this codebase, but if you enjoy reading garbage code or your like a masochist, go ahead.
